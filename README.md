## MetabaseNet introduction

* MetabaseNet reinvents the concept of “Smart Contract” by allowing authors and verifiers of contracts to profit together, and proposes a smarter verification method - “Proof of Authority”, making it the most energy efficient solution and the fastest blockchain to date that is ideal for solving the everyday issues in global consumer goods market.
* MetabaseNet opens up a new era and creates infinite possibilities for the existing ecosystem, providing all the elements that make a great blockchain.  MetabaseNet is the first blockchain to achieve this speed without any compromise, which in turn makes it the best-performance real-world platform for real-world use.
* Imagine this - if there is a decentralized blockchain that is able to extend to any fields or industries, process all of the global transactions with a lightning speed and it proves to be absolutely safe. These are what MetabaseNet can bring to the table.
* This is why MetabaseNet will be the platform that truly bridges the gap between crypto asset enthusiasts and the rest of the world, as the technology it uses was created specifically to cope with the challenges that the blockchain has faced so far.
* MetabaseNet uses “proof of stake” as its verification method, which makes its energy consumption far less than verification methods of any other blockchain. The energy it consumes is even less than the traditional fiat transactions. With this verification method, MetabaseNet achieved 99.5% less energy consumption, while it is as secure as any other chain.

## Repo Guidelines

* Developers work in their own forks, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.
* If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the development team members simply pulls it.
* If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the change may be discussed in the pull request.
* The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions or are controversial.
* From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure.  Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.
